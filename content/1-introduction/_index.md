# Building a Serverless Weather ETL Pipeline

Welcome to this hands-on workshop where you'll build a complete **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** pipeline using AWS serverless services to collect, process, and visualize weather data.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you'll create a simplified but complete weather data pipeline that demonstrates core ETL concepts using AWS serverless technologies. The workshop is designed to be completed in **2-3 hours** with an estimated cost of **under $10** for the entire experience.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Build a serverless data collection system using AWS Lambda
- Implement data transformation and processing workflows
- Store and query data using Amazon S3 and Athena
- Create visualizations with Amazon QuickSight
- Apply AWS best practices for cost optimization and resource cleanup

## Architecture Overview

Our weather ETL pipeline follows this simplified serverless architecture:

```
OpenWeatherMap API → Lambda Collector → S3 Raw Data → Lambda Processor → S3 Processed Data → Athena Analytics → QuickSight Dashboard
```

**Key Components:**

- **Data Source**: OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data
- **Collection**: AWS Lambda function to fetch weather data
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for both raw and processed data
- **Processing**: AWS Lambda for data transformation
- **Analytics**: Amazon Athena for SQL queries
- **Visualization**: Amazon QuickSight for dashboards

## Workshop Modules

This workshop is organized into 6 modules:

### **Module 1: Introduction and Architecture**

- Workshop overview and learning objectives
- Architecture design and AWS services introduction
- Prerequisites and setup requirements

### **Module 2: Weather Data Collection with OpenWeatherMap**

- Setting up OpenWeatherMap API account
- Creating Lambda function for data collection
- Configuring automated data retrieval
- Testing and monitoring the collection process

### **Module 3: Serverless Data Processing with Lambda**

- Building data transformation Lambda function
- Converting raw weather JSON to analytical format
- Implementing data validation and enrichment
- Setting up processing triggers

### **Module 4: Data Analysis with Amazon Athena**

- Creating S3 data lake structure
- Setting up Athena tables and schemas
- Writing SQL queries for weather analysis
- Exploring data patterns and insights

### **Module 5: Data Visualization with QuickSight**

- Setting up Amazon QuickSight
- Creating weather dashboards
- Building interactive visualizations
- Sharing and publishing dashboards

### **Module 6: Resource Cleanup and Next Steps**

- Comprehensive cleanup checklist
- Cost optimization strategies
- Suggested improvements and extensions
- Additional learning resources

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, ensure you have:

- **AWS Account** with administrative access
- **Basic familiarity** with AWS console
- **Understanding** of basic programming concepts
- **OpenWeatherMap account** (free tier sufficient)

## Estimated Costs

This workshop is designed to be cost-effective:

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Free (up to 1,000 calls/day)
- **AWS Lambda**: ~$1-2 (well within free tier)
- **Amazon S3**: ~$1-2 for storage
- **Amazon Athena**: ~$2-3 for queries
- **Amazon QuickSight**: ~$3-4 (30-day free trial available)

**Total estimated cost**: Under $10 for the complete workshop

## Getting Started

Ready to begin? Let's start with **Module 2: Weather Data Collection with OpenWeatherMap** where you'll set up your data source and create your first Lambda function.
