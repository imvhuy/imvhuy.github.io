# Building ETL Data Pipeline for E-commerce on AWS

#### Overview

In this comprehensive workshop, you will learn how to build a **serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline** for an e-commerce platform using AWS services and real data from DummyJSON API. This hands-on workshop will guide you through creating a simple, cost-effective data processing system that collects, transforms, and analyzes real e-commerce data including products, users, and shopping carts.

#### What You'll Build

You will create a complete **serverless data pipeline** that:

- **Collects** real e-commerce data from DummyJSON API
- **Processes** and transforms data using AWS Lambda
- **Stores** structured data in S3 Data Lake
- **Analyzes** data using Amazon Athena
- **Visualizes** business insights through QuickSight dashboards

{{% notice note%}}
This workshop is designed for developers, data engineers, and cloud architects who want to gain hands-on experience with AWS data services. Prior knowledge of AWS basics and some programming experience (Python/SQL) is recommended but not required.

#### AWS Services You'll Learn

**Data Collection:**

- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute for data collection and processing
- **CloudWatch Events** - Scheduled execution and automation

**Data Storage:**

- **Amazon S3** - Scalable object storage for data lakes
- **S3 Intelligent Tiering** - Cost optimization for data storage

**Analytics & Visualization:**

- **Amazon Athena** - Interactive query service for S3 data
- **Amazon QuickSight** - Business intelligence and visualization

**Monitoring & Management:**

- **Amazon CloudWatch** - Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **AWS IAM** - Identity and access management

**External Integration:**

- **DummyJSON API** - Real e-commerce data source

#### Business Use Cases

This ETL pipeline demonstrates real e-commerce analytics scenarios:

- **Product Analytics** - Product performance analysis and inventory insights
- **Customer Analytics** - User demographics and behavior patterns
- **Sales Analysis** - Shopping cart analysis and conversion tracking
- **Market Research** - Product category trends and pricing analysis
- **Business Intelligence** - Executive dashboards and KPI reporting

#### Architecture Components

1. **Data Sources** - DummyJSON API (products, users, carts, posts, comments)
2. **Collection Layer** - Scheduled Lambda functions for data retrieval
3. **Processing Layer** - Lambda functions for data transformation and partitioning
4. **Storage Layer** - S3 Data Lake with optimized structure
5. **Analytics Layer** - Athena for SQL querying and QuickSight for visualization
6. **Monitoring** - CloudWatch for logging, metrics, and alerting

#### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Understand modern serverless data pipeline architectures
- Master AWS Lambda for data collection and processing
- Build batch analytics capabilities using real data
- Implement monitoring and cost optimization
- Create interactive business dashboards with QuickSight
- Integrate external APIs into AWS data pipelines
- Optimize costs with minimal AWS services (under $3/month)

#### Workshop Duration

- **Total Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Skill Level**: Beginner to Intermediate
- **Cost**: Under $3 using AWS Free Tier (simplified architecture)

#### Prerequisites

- Active AWS account with administrative access
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
- Familiarity with JSON data format and REST APIs
- Internet connection to access DummyJSON API
- Optional: Basic Python or SQL knowledge
