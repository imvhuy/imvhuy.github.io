# Building an ETL Data Pipeline for Weather Analysis on AWS

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will create a simple yet complete weather data pipeline, demonstrating core ETL concepts using AWS serverless technology.

This workshop shows how to build a simple ETL pipeline using AWS serverless technology:

- **Collect** weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using AWS Lambda
- **Process** and transform raw data into an analytics-ready format
- **Store** data in Amazon S3 for both raw and processed data
- **Analyze** data using Amazon Athena with SQL queries
- **Visualize** insights through an Amazon QuickSight dashboard
- **Clean up** resources to optimize costs

### Technologies Used:

- This workshop uses AWS Lambda, S3, Athena, and QuickSight combined with the OpenWeatherMap API to build a serverless ETL pipeline for collecting and analyzing weather data.
