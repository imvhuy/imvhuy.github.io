# Building ETL Data Pipeline for E-commerce on AWS

#### Overview

In this comprehensive workshop, you will learn how to build a **real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline** for an e-commerce platform using various AWS services. This hands-on workshop will guide you through creating a scalable, cost-effective data processing system that can handle high-volume e-commerce data streams including customer orders, product interactions, and website analytics.

#### What You'll Build

You will create a complete **data pipeline architecture** that:

- **Ingests** real-time e-commerce data streams
- **Processes** and transforms data using serverless computing
- **Stores** structured data for analytics and reporting
- **Visualizes** business insights through interactive dashboards

#### AWS Services You'll Learn

**Data Ingestion & Streaming:**

- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** - Real-time data streaming service
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** - Data delivery service for analytics

**Serverless Computing:**

- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute for data processing
- **Amazon API Gateway** - RESTful APIs for data ingestion

**Data Storage:**

- **Amazon S3** - Scalable object storage for data lakes
- **Amazon DynamoDB** - NoSQL database for real-time applications

**Analytics & Visualization:**

- **Amazon Athena** - Interactive query service
- **Amazon QuickSight** - Business intelligence and visualization

**Monitoring & Management:**

- **Amazon CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging
- **AWS CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as Code

#### Business Use Cases

This ETL pipeline can handle various e-commerce scenarios:

- **Order Processing** - Real-time order validation and inventory updates
- **Customer Analytics** - User behavior tracking and personalization
- **Inventory Management** - Stock level monitoring and alerts
- **Sales Reporting** - Real-time sales dashboards and KPIs
- **Fraud Detection** - Anomaly detection in transaction patterns

#### Architecture Components

1. **Data Sources** - Simulated e-commerce events (orders, clicks, reviews)
2. **Ingestion Layer** - Kinesis Data Streams and API Gateway
3. **Processing Layer** - Lambda functions for data transformation
4. **Storage Layer** - S3 Data Lake and DynamoDB for structured data
5. **Analytics Layer** - Athena for querying and QuickSight for visualization
6. **Monitoring** - CloudWatch for system health and performance

#### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- ✅ Understand modern data pipeline architectures
- ✅ Master serverless data processing on AWS
- ✅ Build real-time analytics capabilities
- ✅ Implement monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Create interactive business dashboards
- ✅ Optimize costs using AWS Free Tier services

#### Workshop Duration

- **Total Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Skill Level**: Beginner to Intermediate
- **Cost**: Under $5 using AWS Free Tier
