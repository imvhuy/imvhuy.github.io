# Building ETL Data Pipeline for Weather Analytics on AWS

#### Overview

In this comprehensive workshop, you will learn how to build a **serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline** for weather analytics using AWS services and real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API. This hands-on workshop will guide you through creating a simple, cost-effective data processing system that collects, transforms, and analyzes real weather data including current conditions, forecasts, and historical trends across multiple cities.

#### What You'll Build

You will create a complete **serverless data pipeline** that:

- **Collects** real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- **Processes** and transforms weather data using AWS Lambda
- **Stores** structured weather data in S3 Data Lake
- **Analyzes** weather patterns using Amazon Athena
- **Visualizes** weather insights through QuickSight dashboards

{{% notice note%}}
This workshop is designed for developers, data engineers, and cloud architects who want to gain hands-on experience with AWS data services. Prior knowledge of AWS basics and some programming experience (Python/SQL) is recommended but not required. You'll need an OpenWeatherMap API key (free tier available).

#### AWS Services You'll Learn

**Data Collection:**

- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute for weather data collection and processing
- **CloudWatch Events** - Scheduled execution and automation (hourly/daily)

**Data Storage:**

- **Amazon S3** - Scalable object storage for weather data lakes
- **S3 Intelligent Tiering** - Cost optimization for data storage

**Analytics & Visualization:**

- **Amazon Athena** - Interactive query service for S3 weather data
- **Amazon QuickSight** - Business intelligence and weather visualization

**Monitoring & Management:**

- **Amazon CloudWatch** - Monitoring, logging, and weather alerting
- **AWS IAM** - Identity and access management
- **SNS** - Weather alert notifications

**External Integration:**

- **OpenWeatherMap API** - Real-time weather data source (Developer Plan)

#### Business Use Cases

This weather ETL pipeline demonstrates real-world analytics scenarios:

- **Climate Analysis** - Temperature, humidity, and pressure trend analysis
- **Agriculture Intelligence** - Weather conditions for crop planning and irrigation
- **Tourism Planning** - Seasonal weather patterns for travel recommendations
- **Energy Management** - Weather-based energy demand forecasting
- **Logistics Optimization** - Weather-aware supply chain and transportation
- **Risk Management** - Weather alert systems for disaster preparedness

#### Architecture Components

1. **Data Sources** - OpenWeatherMap API (current weather, forecasts, historical data)
2. **Collection Layer** - Scheduled Lambda functions for multi-city weather retrieval
3. **Processing Layer** - Lambda functions for data transformation and enrichment
4. **Storage Layer** - S3 Data Lake with date/city partitioning
5. **Analytics Layer** - Athena for SQL querying and QuickSight for weather visualization
6. **Monitoring** - CloudWatch for logging, metrics, and weather alerting

#### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Understand modern serverless data pipeline architectures
- Master AWS Lambda for real-time weather data collection
- Build analytics capabilities using live weather data
- Implement monitoring and weather alert systems
- Create interactive weather dashboards with QuickSight
- Integrate external weather APIs into AWS data pipelines
- Optimize costs with minimal AWS services (under $5/month)

#### Workshop Duration

- **Total Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Skill Level**: Beginner to Intermediate
- **Cost**: Under $5 using AWS Free Tier + OpenWeatherMap Developer Plan

#### Prerequisites

- Active AWS account with administrative access
- OpenWeatherMap API key (Developer Plan recommended - 1M calls/month)
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
- Familiarity with JSON data format and REST APIs
- Internet connection to access OpenWeatherMap API
- Optional: Basic Python or SQL knowledge
