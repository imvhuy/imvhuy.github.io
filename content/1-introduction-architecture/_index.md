# Introduction & Architecture Design

## Workshop Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive workshop on building an **ETL Data Pipeline for E-commerce** using AWS services! This hands-on session will guide you through creating a modern, serverless data processing system that can handle real-world e-commerce scenarios.

### What is ETL?

**ETL** stands for **Extract, Transform, Load** - a fundamental data integration process:

- **Extract**: Collect data from various sources (websites, databases, APIs)
- **Transform**: Clean, validate, and restructure data for analysis
- **Load**: Store processed data in target systems for analytics

In e-commerce, ETL pipelines are crucial for:

- Processing customer orders in real-time
- Analyzing user behavior and website interactions
- Managing inventory and supply chain data
- Generating business intelligence reports

### Why AWS for ETL?

AWS provides powerful, cost-effective services for building modern data pipelines:

**Serverless Architecture** - No server management, automatic scaling
**Pay-as-you-go** - Only pay for what you use
**Managed Services** - Focus on business logic, not infrastructure
**Real-time Processing** - Handle streaming data efficiently
**Integration** - Services work seamlessly together

## Architecture Overview

Our ETL pipeline will implement a **modern data architecture** with the following components:

![ETL Pipeline Architecture](/images/etl/architecture-overview.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)

### 1. Data Sources (E-commerce Events)

We'll simulate typical e-commerce events:

- **Customer Orders**: Purchase transactions, order items, payment info
- **Website Interactions**: Page views, product clicks, search queries
- **Product Reviews**: Customer feedback and ratings
- **Inventory Updates**: Stock changes, new products

### 2. Data Ingestion Layer

**Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** will capture real-time events:

- Handle high-throughput data streams
- Provide durable, scalable data ingestion
- Enable real-time processing capabilities

**Amazon API Gateway** will provide REST endpoints:

- Secure API access for data submission
- Rate limiting and authentication
- Integration with downstream services

### 3. Data Processing Layer

**AWS Lambda** functions will transform data:

- Serverless, auto-scaling compute
- Event-driven processing
- Data validation and enrichment
- Format conversions (JSON to Parquet)

### 4. Data Storage Layer

**Amazon S3** as our Data Lake:

- Scalable, durable object storage
- Multiple storage classes for cost optimization
- Foundation for analytics workloads

**Amazon DynamoDB** for operational data:

- Fast NoSQL database for real-time applications
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Low-latency data access

### 5. Analytics Layer

**Amazon Athena** for SQL queries:

- Serverless query service
- Query data directly in S3
- Standard SQL interface

**Amazon QuickSight** for visualization:

- Business intelligence service
- Interactive dashboards
- Mobile-friendly reports

### 6. Monitoring & Management

**Amazon CloudWatch**:

- Monitor system health and performance
- Set up alerts and notifications
- Track costs and resource usage

## Data Flow Architecture

    E --> G[Athena]
    G --> H[QuickSight]
    I[CloudWatch] --> D
    I --> C
    I --> F
```

### Real-time Flow:

1. **Customer actions** generate events on e-commerce website
2. **API Gateway** receives and validates incoming requests
3. **Kinesis** streams capture events in real-time
4. **Lambda** processes and transforms data
5. **S3** stores processed data for analytics
6. **DynamoDB** maintains operational data
7. **Athena** queries historical data
8. **QuickSight** creates visual dashboards

## Sample Data Schema

Our pipeline will process various e-commerce events. Here are example schemas:

### Order Event

```json
{
  "event_type": "order_created",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "order_id": "ord_123456",
  "customer_id": "cust_789",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "prod_001",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 29.99
    }
  ],
  "total_amount": 59.98,
  "payment_method": "credit_card",
  "shipping_address": {
    "city": "Ho Chi Minh City",
    "country": "Vietnam"
  }
}
```

### Click Event

```json
{
  "event_type": "product_view",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:25:00Z",
  "session_id": "sess_abc123",
  "customer_id": "cust_789",
  "product_id": "prod_001",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "page_url": "/products/laptop-gaming",
  "referrer": "google.com"
}
```

### Review Event

```json
{
  "event_type": "review_submitted",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T11:00:00Z",
  "review_id": "rev_456",
  "customer_id": "cust_789",
  "product_id": "prod_001",
  "rating": 5,
  "review_text": "Excellent laptop!",
  "verified_purchase": true
}
```

## Expected Outcomes
