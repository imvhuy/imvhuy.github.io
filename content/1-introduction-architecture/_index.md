## Workshop Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive workshop on building an **ETL Data Pipeline for E-commerce** using AWS services! This hands-on session will guide you through creating a modern, serverless data processing system that can handle real-world e-commerce scenarios.

### What is ETL?

**ETL** stands for **Extract, Transform, Load** - a fundamental data integration process:

- **Extract**: Collect data from various sources (websites, databases, APIs)
- **Transform**: Clean, validate, and restructure data for analysis
- **Load**: Store processed data in target systems for analytics

In e-commerce, ETL pipelines are crucial for:

- Processing customer orders in real-time
- Analyzing user behavior and website interactions
- Managing inventory and supply chain data
- Generating business intelligence reports

### Why AWS for ETL?

AWS provides powerful, cost-effective services for building modern data pipelines:

**Serverless Architecture** - No server management, automatic scaling
**Pay-as-you-go** - Only pay for what you use
**Managed Services** - Focus on business logic, not infrastructure
**Real-time Processing** - Handle streaming data efficiently
**Integration** - Services work seamlessly together

## Architecture Overview

Our ETL pipeline will implement a **modern data architecture** with the following components:

![ETL Pipeline Architecture](/images/etl/architecture-overview.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)

### 1. Data Sources (Real E-commerce API)

We'll use **DummyJSON API** to get realistic e-commerce data:

- **Products**: 100+ real product catalog from DummyJSON `/products` endpoint
- **Users**: 30 customer profiles from `/users` endpoint
- **Carts**: 20 shopping cart transactions from `/carts` endpoint
- **Posts & Comments**: User-generated content for reviews simulation
- **Batch Processing**: Daily data collection and analysis

### 2. Data Collection Layer

**AWS Lambda (Scheduled)** will collect data from DummyJSON:

- Serverless, cost-effective data collection
- Scheduled execution using CloudWatch Events
- No infrastructure management required
- Built-in retry and error handling

### 3. Data Processing Layer

**AWS Lambda** functions will transform and store data:

- Clean and normalize DummyJSON data
- Transform JSON to Parquet format
- Partition data by date for efficient querying
- Generate analytics-ready datasets

### 4. Data Storage Layer

**Amazon S3** as our Data Lake:

- Scalable, durable object storage
- Partitioned by date for efficient queries
- Multiple formats: Raw JSON and Parquet
- Cost-optimized with S3 Intelligent Tiering

### 5. Analytics Layer

**Amazon Athena** for SQL queries:

- Serverless query service
- Query data directly in S3
- Standard SQL interface

**Amazon QuickSight** for visualization:

- Business intelligence service
- Interactive dashboards
- Mobile-friendly reports

### 6. Monitoring & Management

**Amazon CloudWatch**:

- Monitor system health and performance
- Set up alerts and notifications
- Track costs and resource usage

## Data Flow Architecture

    D --> E[S3 Data Lake]
    E --> F[Athena]
    F --> G[QuickSight]
    H[CloudWatch Logs] --> B
    H --> D
```

### ETL Data Flow:

1. **CloudWatch Events** triggers Lambda on schedule (daily)
2. **Lambda Collector** fetches data from DummyJSON API endpoints
3. **Lambda Processor** transforms and validates data
4. **S3 Data Lake** stores both raw and processed data
5. **Athena** queries data using standard SQL
6. **QuickSight** creates interactive dashboards and reports

## Sample Data Schema

Our pipeline will process real data from **DummyJSON API**. Here are the actual data structures:

### DummyJSON Product Data

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "iPhone 9",
  "description": "An apple mobile which is nothing like apple",
  "price": 549,
  "discountPercentage": 12.96,
  "rating": 4.69,
  "stock": 94,
  "brand": "Apple",
  "category": "smartphones",
  "thumbnail": "https://dummyjson.com/image/i/products/1/thumbnail.jpg",
  "images": ["https://dummyjson.com/image/i/products/1/1.jpg"]
}
```

### DummyJSON User Data

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "Emily",
  "lastName": "Johnson",
  "maidenName": "Smith",
  "age": 28,
  "gender": "female",
  "email": "emily.johnson@x.dummyjson.com",
  "phone": "+81 965-431-3024",
  "address": {
    "address": "626 Main Street",
    "city": "Phoenix",
    "coordinates": { "lat": 33.4484, "lng": -112.074 },
    "postalCode": "85001",
    "state": "Arizona"
  }
}
```

### Transformed E-commerce Event

```json
{
  "event_type": "product_purchase",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "transaction_id": "txn_123456",
  "user_id": 1,
  "product": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "iPhone 9",
    "price": 549,
    "category": "smartphones",
    "brand": "Apple"
  },
  "quantity": 1,
  "total_amount": 549,
  "user_location": {
    "city": "Phoenix",
    "state": "Arizona",
    "country": "USA"
  }
}
```
