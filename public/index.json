	"content": "Building ETL Data Pipeline for Weather Analytics on AWS Overview In this comprehensive workshop, you will learn how to build a serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline for weather analytics using AWS services and real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API. This hands-on workshop will guide you through creating a simple, cost-effective data processing system that collects, transforms, and analyzes real weather data including current conditions, forecasts, and historical trends across multiple cities.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Build You will create a complete serverless data pipeline that:\nCollects real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API Processes and transforms weather data using AWS Lambda Stores structured weather data in S3 Data Lake Analyzes weather patterns using Amazon Athena Visualizes weather insights through QuickSight dashboards This workshop is designed for developers, data engineers, and cloud architects who want to gain hands-on experience with AWS data services. Prior knowledge of AWS basics and some programming experience (Python/SQL) is recommended but not required. You\u0026rsquo;ll need an OpenWeatherMap API key (free tier available).\nAWS Services You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn Data Collection:\nAWS Lambda - Serverless compute for weather data collection and processing CloudWatch Events - Scheduled execution and automation (hourly/daily) Data Storage:\nAmazon S3 - Scalable object storage for weather data lakes S3 Intelligent Tiering - Cost optimization for data storage Analytics \u0026amp; Visualization:\nAmazon Athena - Interactive query service for S3 weather data Amazon QuickSight - Business intelligence and weather visualization Monitoring \u0026amp; Management:\nAmazon CloudWatch - Monitoring, logging, and weather alerting AWS IAM - Identity and access management SNS - Weather alert notifications External Integration:\nOpenWeatherMap API - Real-time weather data source (Developer Plan) Business Use Cases This weather ETL pipeline demonstrates real-world analytics scenarios:\nClimate Analysis - Temperature, humidity, and pressure trend analysis Agriculture Intelligence - Weather conditions for crop planning and irrigation Tourism Planning - Seasonal weather patterns for travel recommendations Energy Management - Weather-based energy demand forecasting Logistics Optimization - Weather-aware supply chain and transportation Risk Management - Weather alert systems for disaster preparedness Architecture Components Data Sources - OpenWeatherMap API (current weather, forecasts, historical data) Collection Layer - Scheduled Lambda functions for multi-city weather retrieval Processing Layer - Lambda functions for data transformation and enrichment Storage Layer - S3 Data Lake with date/city partitioning Analytics Layer - Athena for SQL querying and QuickSight for weather visualization Monitoring - CloudWatch for logging, metrics, and weather alerting Expected Outcomes By the end of this workshop, you will:\nUnderstand modern serverless data pipeline architectures Master AWS Lambda for real-time weather data collection Build analytics capabilities using live weather data Implement monitoring and weather alert systems Create interactive weather dashboards with QuickSight Integrate external weather APIs into AWS data pipelines Optimize costs with minimal AWS services (under $5/month) Workshop Duration Total Time: 4-6 hours Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate Cost: Under $5 using AWS Free Tier + OpenWeatherMap Developer Plan Prerequisites Active AWS account with administrative access OpenWeatherMap API key (Developer Plan recommended - 1M calls/month) Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts Familiarity with JSON data format and REST APIs Internet connection to access OpenWeatherMap API Optional: Basic Python or SQL knowledge Workshop Modules Introduction \u0026amp; Architecture Design Weather Data Collection with Lambda Data Processing and Transformation Setting up S3 Data Lake Analytics with Amazon Athena Weather Visualization with QuickSight Cleanup and Next Steps "

	"content": "Building a Serverless Weather ETL Pipeline Welcome to this hands-on workshop where you\u0026rsquo;ll build a complete Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using AWS serverless services to collect, process, and visualize weather data.\nWorkshop Overview In this workshop, you\u0026rsquo;ll create a simplified but complete weather data pipeline that demonstrates core ETL concepts using AWS serverless technologies. The workshop is designed to be completed in 2-3 hours with an estimated cost of under $10 for the entire experience.\nLearning Objectives By the end of this workshop, you will:\nBuild a serverless data collection system using AWS Lambda Implement data transformation and processing workflows Store and query data using Amazon S3 and Athena Create visualizations with Amazon QuickSight Apply AWS best practices for cost optimization and resource cleanup Architecture Overview Our weather ETL pipeline follows this simplified serverless architecture:\nOpenWeatherMap API → Lambda Collector → S3 Raw Data → Lambda Processor → S3 Processed Data → Athena Analytics → QuickSight Dashboard Key Components:\nData Source: OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data Collection: AWS Lambda function to fetch weather data Storage: Amazon S3 for both raw and processed data Processing: AWS Lambda for data transformation Analytics: Amazon Athena for SQL queries Visualization: Amazon QuickSight for dashboards Workshop Modules This workshop is organized into 6 modules:\nModule 1: Introduction and Architecture Workshop overview and learning objectives Architecture design and AWS services introduction Prerequisites and setup requirements Module 2: Weather Data Collection with OpenWeatherMap Setting up OpenWeatherMap API account Creating Lambda function for data collection Configuring automated data retrieval Testing and monitoring the collection process Module 3: Serverless Data Processing with Lambda Building data transformation Lambda function Converting raw weather JSON to analytical format Implementing data validation and enrichment Setting up processing triggers Module 4: Data Analysis with Amazon Athena Creating S3 data lake structure Setting up Athena tables and schemas Writing SQL queries for weather analysis Exploring data patterns and insights Module 5: Data Visualization with QuickSight Setting up Amazon QuickSight Creating weather dashboards Building interactive visualizations Sharing and publishing dashboards Module 6: Resource Cleanup and Next Steps Comprehensive cleanup checklist Cost optimization strategies Suggested improvements and extensions Additional learning resources Prerequisites Before starting this workshop, ensure you have:\nAWS Account with administrative access Basic familiarity with AWS console Understanding of basic programming concepts OpenWeatherMap account (free tier sufficient) Estimated Costs This workshop is designed to be cost-effective:\nOpenWeatherMap API: Free (up to 1,000 calls/day) AWS Lambda: ~$1-2 (well within free tier) Amazon S3: ~$1-2 for storage Amazon Athena: ~$2-3 for queries Amazon QuickSight: ~$3-4 (30-day free trial available) Total estimated cost: Under $10 for the complete workshop\nGetting Started Ready to begin? Let\u0026rsquo;s start with Module 2: Weather Data Collection with OpenWeatherMap where you\u0026rsquo;ll set up your data source and create your first Lambda function.\nNote: Remember to follow the cleanup procedures in Module 6 to avoid ongoing charges after completing the workshop.\n"
