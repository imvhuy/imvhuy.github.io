	"content": "Introduction \u0026amp; Architecture Design Workshop Overview Welcome to this comprehensive workshop on building an ETL Data Pipeline for E-commerce using AWS services! This hands-on session will guide you through creating a modern, serverless data processing system that can handle real-world e-commerce scenarios.\nWhat is ETL? ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load - a fundamental data integration process:\nExtract: Collect data from various sources (websites, databases, APIs) Transform: Clean, validate, and restructure data for analysis Load: Store processed data in target systems for analytics In e-commerce, ETL pipelines are crucial for:\nProcessing customer orders in real-time Analyzing user behavior and website interactions Managing inventory and supply chain data Generating business intelligence reports Why AWS for ETL? AWS provides powerful, cost-effective services for building modern data pipelines:\nServerless Architecture - No server management, automatic scaling Pay-as-you-go - Only pay for what you use Managed Services - Focus on business logic, not infrastructure Real-time Processing - Handle streaming data efficiently Integration - Services work seamlessly together\nArchitecture Overview Our ETL pipeline will implement a modern data architecture with the following components:\n1. Data Sources (E-commerce Events) We\u0026rsquo;ll simulate typical e-commerce events:\nCustomer Orders: Purchase transactions, order items, payment info Website Interactions: Page views, product clicks, search queries Product Reviews: Customer feedback and ratings Inventory Updates: Stock changes, new products 2. Data Ingestion Layer Amazon Kinesis Data Streams will capture real-time events:\nHandle high-throughput data streams Provide durable, scalable data ingestion Enable real-time processing capabilities Amazon API Gateway will provide REST endpoints:\nSecure API access for data submission Rate limiting and authentication Integration with downstream services 3. Data Processing Layer AWS Lambda functions will transform data:\nServerless, auto-scaling compute Event-driven processing Data validation and enrichment Format conversions (JSON to Parquet) 4. Data Storage Layer Amazon S3 as our Data Lake:\nScalable, durable object storage Multiple storage classes for cost optimization Foundation for analytics workloads Amazon DynamoDB for operational data:\nFast NoSQL database for real-time applications Auto-scaling capabilities Low-latency data access 5. Analytics Layer Amazon Athena for SQL queries:\nServerless query service Query data directly in S3 Standard SQL interface Amazon QuickSight for visualization:\nBusiness intelligence service Interactive dashboards Mobile-friendly reports 6. Monitoring \u0026amp; Management Amazon CloudWatch:\nMonitor system health and performance Set up alerts and notifications Track costs and resource usage Data Flow Architecture graph TD\rA[E-commerce Website] --\u0026gt; B[API Gateway]\rB --\u0026gt; C[Kinesis Data Streams]\rC --\u0026gt; D[Lambda Functions]\rD --\u0026gt; E[S3 Data Lake]\rD --\u0026gt; F[DynamoDB]\rE --\u0026gt; G[Athena]\rG --\u0026gt; H[QuickSight]\rI[CloudWatch] --\u0026gt; D\rI --\u0026gt; C\rI --\u0026gt; F Real-time Flow: Customer actions generate events on e-commerce website API Gateway receives and validates incoming requests Kinesis streams capture events in real-time Lambda processes and transforms data S3 stores processed data for analytics DynamoDB maintains operational data Athena queries historical data QuickSight creates visual dashboards Sample Data Schema Our pipeline will process various e-commerce events. Here are example schemas:\nOrder Event { \u0026#34;event_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;order_created\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;order_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ord_123456\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customer_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cust_789\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;items\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;product_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;prod_001\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;quantity\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: 29.99 } ], \u0026#34;total_amount\u0026#34;: 59.98, \u0026#34;payment_method\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;credit_card\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;shipping_address\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ho Chi Minh City\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;country\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Vietnam\u0026#34; } } Click Event { \u0026#34;event_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;product_view\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-01-15T10:25:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;session_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sess_abc123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customer_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cust_789\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;product_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;prod_001\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Electronics\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;page_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/products/laptop-gaming\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;referrer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;google.com\u0026#34; } Review Event { \u0026#34;event_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;review_submitted\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-01-15T11:00:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;review_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;rev_456\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customer_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cust_789\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;product_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;prod_001\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rating\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;review_text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Excellent laptop!\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;verified_purchase\u0026#34;: true } Expected Outcomes By the end of this workshop, you\u0026rsquo;ll have built:\nðŸŽ¯ A complete ETL pipeline handling real-time e-commerce data ðŸ“Š Interactive dashboards showing business metrics ðŸ”§ Serverless architecture that scales automatically ðŸ’° Cost-optimized solution using AWS Free Tier ðŸ“ˆ Real-time analytics capabilities for business insights\nPrerequisites Check Before we start building, ensure you have:\nâœ… AWS Account with administrative access âœ… AWS CLI installed and configured (optional) âœ… Basic understanding of JSON data format âœ… Text editor for code editing âœ… Web browser for AWS Console access Cost Management: While this workshop uses AWS Free Tier services, always monitor your usage and set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.\nWorkshop Structure This workshop is divided into 8 hands-on modules:\n[Current] Introduction \u0026amp; Architecture Design [Next] Setting up Data Ingestion with Kinesis Building Serverless Data Processing with Lambda Implementing Data Storage Solutions Creating Analytics and Visualization Monitoring and Optimization Testing and Validation Cleanup and Next Steps Ready to start building?
